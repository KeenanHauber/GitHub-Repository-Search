# GitHub-Repository-Search

GitHub Repository Search is a WIP example project to display some of my skills as a developer. It is written in Swift 5 with a Clean Swift architecture.

Simply clone the repository, open the XCode project and build the app.

The app allows a user to search for a list of organisations on GitHub matching a given string, view the repositories associated with that organisation, and view that repository on GitHub. At time of writing, all development focus has been placed on writing code, and the UI is very simple. This project is *not* meant to have a polished UI (although I am seriously considering giving it one).
