     Repositories for a fetch are automatically cached in the organisation object. If a list of repositories
     have already been fetched, the completion handler will be called synchronously with no new query being executed.
     This may be overriden by setting `refresh` to true, in which case the service will fetch new data anyway.

     - parameter refresh: forces data to be fetched from the server, even if there is cached data
     - parameter completionHandler: called when the fetch has completed
     
     Organisations for a search term are automatically cached to save re-fetching data that has already been successfully fetched. If a search is executed twice
     and the first was successful, completion handler will be called synchronously with no new query being executed. A proper fetch may be forced by setting
     `refresh` to `true`.
